## CSCA 5622 Supervised Learning

### Final Project

---

## Questions

- What does a Billboard #1 song sound like?
- Can we predict how popular a song will be?

---

## Data

---

### Billboard charts

- top 100 most popular songs
- updated weekly
- 2010 to 2020

### Spotify audio features

- energy / danceability
- liveness / tempo
- speechiness
- ...

---

## Data preparation

- weekly -> statistics
- merge datasets

---

`data.ipynb`

---

## Learning

- exploration
- classification vs regression
- models - RandomForest, SVC, Boosting
- metadata vs. audio features

---

`model_v3.ipynb`

## Conclusion

**The higher a song enters the Billboard chart and the longer it stays on,
the higher position it will reach.**

Audio features do not predict the song placement.
